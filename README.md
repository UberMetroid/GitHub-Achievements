# GitHub Achievements

A practical playbook + tools for earning GitHub achievements the *legit* way.

## What’s in here

- `docs/ACHIEVEMENTS.md` — thresholds, tactics, and guardrails
- `scripts/earn_achievements.py` — local automation to create *real* work items (issues/PR templates) and track progress

## Quick start

```bash
cd GitHub-Achievements
python3 scripts/earn_achievements.py status
```

## Guardrails

This repo only supports **legitimate** actions (real PRs, real reviews, real issues). No spam, no fake PRs, no abuse.
